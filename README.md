# Hypergraps_plotting

A notebook w/ a few tricks to plot Hypergraphs in Julia.

The notebooks are in the `notebook` subdirectory (Duh).

You may notice that most scripts start with the commands:
```julia
using DrWatson
@quickactivate "Hypergraps_plotting"
```
which auto-activate the project and enable local path handling
