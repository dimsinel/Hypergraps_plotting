    "docs_d={'Roman bortsch': 'this soup combines two separate recipes attributed to the agricul¬turalist and linguist varro. as a remedy it could be drunk to aid the digestion, and it also served as a soup with the chicken included. i choose to leave the meat in, to give some texture to the soup. the dish is quite unusual in not using fish sauce. the sweet/savoury balance is surprisingly good.   500 ml white wine  500 ml water  100 g honey  1 leg and thigh of a large chicken  2 tbsp olive oil  4 medium-sized raw beetroot  salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste    combine the wine, water and honey in a medium-sized saucepan. add the chicken leg and bring to heat slowly. (were you making a larger quantity, you would use a whole chicken.) while the stock is simmering, peel and grate the beetroot. add to the soup and top up with more wine or water as it reduces. cook for about 1½ hrs. take out the chicken, skin and shred the meat from the bone and return some or most of it to your serving bowl. skim the fat from the surface of the soup, season with salt and pepper, pour over the meat and serve.',\n",
    " 'Barley and vegetable soup': 'this is a nourishing and warming soup, quite delicious and modern in its taste and texture. there is a long list of green vegetables required, though it is really unnecessary to stick rigidly to the list supplied in apicius: the cook would have used whatever he was able to obtain, as we must do. i was testing the recipe in the winter and was rather limited in my choice. the original recipe calls for leek, coriander, green dill, green fennel leaf (you will find sufficient on 1 or 2 fennel bulbs), spinach beet and cabbage, none of which should give you much trouble outside the coldest season. only leaves of mallow (m. sylvestris) would be more problematic as they are a summer crop and are not normally cultivated in britain. the addition of asafoetida to the soup is desirable for those who like it, but i left it out of my portion as it is often not to my taste. this recipe makes four generous or six smaller bowls.   60 g chickpeas  60 g red or brown lentils  60 g green split peas  60 g pearl barley  2 small leeks with the darkest green removed  150 g cabbage  100 g yellow or red swiss chard or spinach beet  100 g mallow leaves or a substitute such as baby spinach, pak choi,  chinese cabbage or any suitable green-leafed vegetable  10 g each of fennel leaf and dill weed  50 g fresh coriander  800 ml water  2 heaped tsp fennel seed  ½ level tsp lovage seed  ½ tsp dried oregano  2 tbsp fish sauce  generous freshly ground black pepper    soak the dried pulses separately overnight in cold water. using a spice or coffee grinder mill the barley until most of the grains are broken at least once. do not go too far and create barley flour. put the chickpeas in a pan filled with fresh water first and, after they have come to the boil and cooked for 10 minutes, add the remaining pulses and barley. cook them all together until tender. wash, trim, and shred the green vegetables and roughly chop the herbs. put the coarser green leaves such as the cabbage in first (but retain 50 g of that as a garnish) and bring the soup back to the boil and continue to cook. add the softer greens and the green herbs and continue to simmer gently. add a little hot water if necessary to achieve a thick soup consistency. cook the extra shredded cabbage lightly and retain until the end. roast and grind the fennel and lovage seeds and add with the oregano. flavour with the fish sauce and pepper and taste. the pulses need a lot of salt as a rule but you do not want too strong a fish sauce taste either. serve in a large serving vessel with the lightly cooked shredded cabbage sprinkled over the top.',\n",
    " 'Beef or lamb faggots': 'we might claim these meat faggots as the closest thing to a burger in roman recipes. the meat of choice is pounded in a mortar with a pestle until a smooth paste is formed. this takes considerable time and effort and it has to be admitted that the work is done in a frac¬tion of the time in a food processor. once the faggots have been made they can be oven baked, grilled or even barbecued as the original recipe suggests. the flavour of the myrtle berries is interesting, rather flowery and unexpected; if they cannot be obtained, juniper berries serve as a suitable alternative. caul fat is the membrane that holds the intestines together in the intestinal cavity in all animals though pig’s caul is generally the one most readily available. you will find caul fat at any butcher’s who makes his own sausages and especially if he makes faggots. you may have to buy a large quantity as it comes in ½ kg frozen blocks but it is very inexpensive.   250 g beef or lamb mince  50 g fresh bread crumbs  2 tbsp white wine  1 tbsp fish sauce  25 g pine kernels  2 large tsp whole black peppercorns cracked in a mortar  5 myrtle berries or, if unavailable, 3 juniper berries  50 g caul fat    place the meat, bread crumbs, wine and fish sauce in a food processor; process until the whole has formed a smooth paste and the mince has lost its structure. add the pine kernels and peppercorns and pulse briefly to combine them evenly. transfer to a bowl. open up each individual piece of caul fat to its full extent. take a lump of the mixture and form it into a small ball about the size of an egg. lay it on the edge of the sheet of fat and cut a circle round it about twice as big as the ball. take up the ball with its fat and pull and stretch the fat to cover the ball. place it down on the bench and flatten it out. ensure that the minimum amount of fat is used for each ball and do not fold over the excess but cut it off. grill, roast in a hot oven or barbecue until well done, brown and crisp. serve with a sweet wine oenogarum, see page 33. you can also make them smaller and serve them on cocktail sticks as party food.',\n",
    " 'Chicken pottage to serve with meatballs': 'this sauce is thickened with a paste of cooked rice and the resulting mixture is reminiscent of the mushy-pea pottage on page 93 that is also served with meatballs. it is quite likely that such plain and relatively simple food was served outside the home at the better popina or taverns and also at the dining-rooms of collegia or trade guilds.   650 ml fresh chicken stock  20 g pudding rice  ½ leek sliced thinly  1 tsp dill weed  1 tsp celery seed  2 tbsp defrutum (see p. 30)  1 tbsp fish sauce  salt  generous freshly ground pepper    prepare the stock by simmering chicken bones or a chicken quarter in plenty of water for 2 hours. place the rice in a separate pan and add 150 ml of the stock. simmer gently until the rice is very soft and most of the stock has boiled away. cool and mash with a potato masher or process until smooth. strain the bones out the rest of the stock and measure ½ litre into a new pan. add the sliced leek, the dill and a little salt. bring to the heat and cook gently. dry-roast and grind the celery seed and add to the pan. add the defrutum and the fish sauce. take small amounts of the rice paste and beat into the sauce until a thick sauce is achieved. you will probably have some of the rice left. simmer for a few minutes and serve in bowls with meatballs such as those described on the next page.',\n",
    " 'Chicken meatballs in hydrogarum': 'this recipe for meatballs has been ‘created’ to accompany the thick chicken sauce on the previous page. chicken flesh is flavoured with pepper, cumin, fish sauce and sweet wine in keeping with the style of forcemeat elsewhere in the apicius text. the meatballs are cooked in the liquor called hydrogarum described in apicius 2.2.4.   300 g organic corn-fed chicken breast meat  1 tsp roasted and ground cumin seeds  generous freshly ground black pepper  2 tsp chopped fresh parsley  1 tbsp caroenum (see p. 31)  1 tbsp fish sauce  20 g fresh bread crumbs  1 small egg      for poaching:  30 black peppercorns, coarsely ground  1 coffee cup of fish sauce  1 coffee cup of caroenum  11 coffee cups of water    chop the chicken breast and put it in a food processor with the roasted and ground cumin, pepper and parsley. process until quite finely minced. add the liquids, bread crumbs and the egg. pulse for a few moments and turn out into a bowl. put the pepper, fish sauce, caroenum and water in a frying-pan and bring to a gentle simmer. using two dessert spoons, mould little quenelles of chicken meat by scooping from one spoon to the other, and then drop them into the simmering cooking liquor. poach until firm and remove with a slotted spoon. serve with the chicken sauce above. this meatball recipe can also be used with lamb or beef and any other kind of minced fowl or game.',\n",
    " 'Marinated liver': 'liver and all kinds of offal were considered a great luxury in the roman world and this is not surprising given its rarity in relation to the quantity of meat on a carcass and the fact that some offal must be used fresh. here, liver is marinated in a combination of fish sauce, bay berries and lovage, then wrapped in caul. bay berries add the flavour of the bay leaf in a form that can be ground and consumed. the caul gives the liver added moisture while it is cooking and the finished item is an ideal gustum – hors-d’œuvre and finger food at parties.   200 g lamb’s or calf’s liver  ½ tsp lovage seeds  2 bay berries (or a broken bayleaf)  2 tbsp fish sauce  generous freshly ground black pepper  a small amount of caul fat    prepare the liver by removing the larger sinews and skinning if necessary. cut into roughly 5 cm chunks and leave aside in dish. dry-roast the lovage seed and bay berries and grind to a powder in a mortar. add to the liver in the dish with 2 tbsp of fish sauce and the pieces of bay leaf if you cannot get bay berries. turn over in the marinade and leave for a few hours to marinate. open up the caul fat into a sheet and cut pieces a little larger than the liver. wrap each piece. ensure that you use the minimum caul fat necessary; avoid folding the fat too thickly over the liver. grill until the fat is crisp on the outside and the blood ceases to flow when the liver is pierced. these are ideal as barbecue food, but can also be roasted in an oven. serve with a separate dish of a sweet oenogarum (see page 33), on cocktail sticks so they can be dipped into the sauce.',\n",
    " 'Stuffed kidneys': 'this is my favourite apician recipe. i included it in the classical cook book and i make no apology for reproducing it here. this confirms for me that roman slave-cooks were very skilled in their craft of combining flavours and made exceptionally fine food. the flavour of kidney is strong compared with other offal, but the fennel seed and coriander are a good match for it.   2 level tsp fennel seed  generous amount of freshly ground black pepper  large handful fresh coriander (½ a bunch)  100 g pine kernels  8 lamb kidneys  enough caul to cover all the kidneys  1 tbsp fish sauce  olive oil to fry    dry-roast the fennel and grind to a fine powder with the pepper. put this with the coriander and pine kernels in a food processor and process until a firm paste is formed. do not over-mix at this stage or the oil in the nuts will leach out and make the stuffing oily. cut each kidney almost in half, leaving a little flesh to hold them together. remove their cores. fill each cleaned kidney with a generous amount of stuffing and fold the two halves back together. wrap each kidney in the caul fat to secure the stuffing. trim any excess. shallow-fry in a little olive oil to seal and brown the caul fat and then roast in a medium oven (375°f, 190°c, gas 5) until well done. sprinkle a little fish sauce over them in the dish. slice the whole kidneys into 2–3 pieces and serve hot with warm bread – don’t forget the juices from the pan. some of our tasters have even preferred the juice to the meat. alternatively; cut the kidneys in half completely, place stuffing in the hollow and wrap each piece in caul fat so the stuffing is secure. thread them on a skewer and cook on the barbecue until crisp and well done.',\n",
    " 'Prawn balls in hydrogarum': 'the prawn balls are cooked in a special cooking sauce made with fish sauce and water known as hydrogarum. a modern counterpart would be a ‘court bouillon’ designed for poaching. this hydrogarum is flavoured simply with celery leaves and pepper.   300 g raw king prawns  ⅔ tsp lovage seeds  1 level tsp cumin  pinch asafoetida resin or powder  generous freshly ground black pepper  1 egg  2 dessert spoons soft bread crumbs      for the hydrogarum:  1 coffee cup of fish sauce  7 coffee cups of water  a small handful of celery leaves  freshly ground black pepper    peel and clean the intestinal tract from the prawns. pound or process into a paste. roasted and grind the three spices, mix them with the pepper and add to the prawn paste with the egg and bread crumbs. process until combined. in a small, deep frying-pan place 1 measure of fish sauce to 7 measures of water using a small coffee cup. to this add the green leaves from a head of celery. bring to a simmer. check the seasoning, adjust with more pepper if necessary. using two large teaspoons, make egg shaped balls by scooping the mixture from one spoon to the other. drop them in the simmering hydrogarum and gently cook until they have set (no more than 4–5 minutes). serve warm with salad leaves dressed with an oenogarum (see page 57).',\n",
    " 'Chicken salad': 'this form of composite salad has quite an unusual mixture of cold ingredients: bread, cheese, cucumber, capers, cooked chicken livers interlayered with pine kernels with a creamy mint sauce poured over. it is difficult to know precisely how the salad is put together according to the instructions in the original text of apicius as the latin is a little obscure. i had assumed in the past that the bread is meant to line the vessel and the other ingredients are layered inside, but it is also possible that the bread also separates the layers. with either method, the salad can be turned out onto a plate. the dominant flavour of the sauce is mint and celery seed with a creamy egg dressing. i take this dressing to be made from raw egg yolk. this may cause some of you concern. it might be possible to replace the raw egg with a little mayonnaise. this recipe benefits from being made in a large mortar, although a small food processor produces acceptable results.   for the salad:  60 g parmesan cheese  100 g chicken livers  olive oil  ½ cucumber  25 g capers  30 g pine kernels  1–2 large ciabatta loaves  200 ml posca (100 ml water/100 ml white wine vinegar)      for the dressing:  generous freshly ground pepper  1 level tsp celery seed, roasted  3 heaped tsp fresh chopped mint  30 g pine kernels  40 g full fat cream cheese  2 egg yolks  1 tbsp honey  1 tbsp vinegar  1 tbsp fish sauce  80 ml water      prepare the salad ingredients: grate the parmesan cheese; cook chicken livers by frying in a little olive oil, then cool and chop them into small pieces; peel and slice the cucumber thinly; drain and chop the capers finely. cut the ciabatta into thin slices and lay them out on a large tray. dribble the posca over the slices and allow the fluid to be absorbed. repeat occasionally while you prepare the dressing. in a mortar grind the pepper and roasted celery seed. add the mint and the pine kernels and grind to a fine paste. add the soft cheese, egg yolks and the honey and blend again. then dilute the paste with the vinegar and the fish sauce. gradually add the water and blend. take a two-pint pudding bowl and lay a piece of the bread, gently squeezed out and cut to fit, in the bottom. sprinkle a little of all the salad ingredients over this bread, finishing with cucumber, but do not let the slices overlay each other. add another layer of bread and repeat until all the ingredients have been used up. always finish with a layer of bread. pour the dressing over the salad and chill for 2 hours. turn out onto a plate and decorate with more cucumber slices.',\n",
    " 'Asparagus patina': 'a patina could be a simple custard like this one or could resemble a frittata or omelette. it might also be a more elaborate, composite dish made with many layered ingredients. this asparagus custard is surprisingly delicate and quite delicious. the recipe does not require that the asparagus should be cooked, instead the vegetable is pounded and soaked in wine: the juice extracted from this is used for the custard. the asparagus is discarded. it took a number of experiments before we decided that this was not in fact a mistake in the transmission of the recipe. it is a quite different experience to using cooked asparagus as it is so fresh-tasting. it may be that large, coarse asparagus spears that had bolted were used in the original recipe – past their best if eaten as cooked asparagus but suited to this method. this is one of a number of recipes in apicius that have precise quantities, and they work very well here. i have not changed them apart from the number of eggs (ancient eggs were probably much smaller than the average egg today).   300g large asparagus spears  250 ml white wine  45 ml fish sauce  45 ml white wine  45 ml passum (see p. 32)  90 ml olive oil  6g black peppercorns  5 eggs  6 small asparagus spears as a garnish    roughly chop the large asparagus and grind them in the processor until very fine. add the wine and leave to stand for a few hours, or overnight if possible. strain the juice from the vegetable matter and squeeze out as much of the liquor as possible; discard the asparagus pulp. in a separate pan place the fish sauce, wine, passum and olive oil and heat up gently. grind the pepper and add along with the asparagus juice. beat the eggs together and combine with the sauce off the heat. grease an ovenproof dish and pour in the mixture. place inside another larger dish filled with water and slide into a preheated cool oven (300°f, 150°c, gas 2). bake slowly for 25–35 minutes until just set. steam the garnish spears while it is cooking. remove, cool, and garnish with the cooked asparagus. alternatively, bake in separate ramekins. sprinkle with freshly ground pepper.',\n",
    " 'Lettuce patina': 'this patina uses a crisp lettuce with its stalks and is flavoured with caroenum. the lettuce you use could be iceberg or even chicory. i have made it with a chinese cabbage in the past, which has more in common with lettuce and is perfect for this dish as it has thick juicy stalks. unlike the asparagus patina above, the lettuce is pounded and used in the finished dish. it has a simple delicate flavour and is ideal as an accompaniment to any of the meat or fish dishes in this section.   500 g iceberg lettuce or chinese leaves  2 tbsp olive oil  2 tbsp caroenum (see p. 31)  1 tbsp fish sauce  generous freshly ground black pepper  5 eggs      trim the lettuce so you have mainly the lower base and rather less of the green leaf. process or pound into a fine paste. tip into a saucepan and add the oil, caroenum, fish sauce and pepper. bring to heat and cook gently for 5 minutes. grease a shallow ceramic dish and beat the eggs. pour the lettuce purée into the dish and stir in the egg, briskly so that the egg doesn’t cook in the sauce. put in a cool oven (300°f, 150°c, gas 2) until set. sprinkle with pepper and serve in wedges with one of the savoury dishes in this section such as the meatballs or liver.',\n",
    " 'Cheese and fruit dip (Hypotrimma)': 'the name of this sauce is greek and the word is associated with a paste ground in a mortar. in a modern context it may be made in a mortar or a small food processor. the finished sauce is very similar to the sauces in the section on meat dishes on pages 60, 71 and 75. like pickles, they are all thick, sweet and piquant, and almost certainly raw and served cold. we have one reference to a hypotrimma being served with dogfish (which we call rock salmon), though this kind of sauce is so rich that pieces of bread or even crudités would be suitable.   ½ level tsp lovage seeds  generous freshly ground black pepper  3 heaped tsp chopped fresh mint  50 g raisins (softened in a little hot water)  50 g pine kernels  50 g full fat cream cheese  1 tbsp date syrup  1 tbsp honey  1 tbsp fish sauce  2 tbsp vinegar  1 tbsp olive oil  1 tbsp defrutum (see p. 30)  100 ml white wine      roast and grind the lovage, mix with the pepper and add the mint. add the raisins and pound or process to a fine paste. add the pine kernels and continue to process into a paste. add the cheese, date syrup and the honey, and blend. dilute gradually with the fish sauce, vinegar, oil, defrutum and wine. taste; balance the sweetness with a little more vinegar if necessary. tip into a dish and serve with dipping items such as bread, cucumber, carrots, spring onions, cold cuts of meat, large cooked prawns or small pieces of cooked dogfish on cocktail sticks.',\n",
    " 'Melon with mint dressing': 'this is remarkably successful as a simple starter. used with any type of sweet melon the effect is so refreshing and surprising that i have resolved never to serve melon any other way again. it is ideal as an alternative to sorbet at a modern dinner party as a refreshing amuse¬bouche between courses. it is also a potential dessert. pennyroyal (mentha pulegium) is a low ground-cover mint with a strong, dense flavour. i have access to a large patch in my garden and it is good to use the original suggestion from the manuscript of apicius, but for ordinary purposes a standard dried or fresh mint will do.   1 round sweet ripe melon such as galia, honeydew, etc.  generous freshly ground black pepper  2 tsp dried mint or 3 tsp of fresh chopped pennyroyal or culinary mint  2 dessert spoons runny honey  1 dessert spoon fish sauce  2 dessert spoons vinegar      cut the melon into quarters and take the flesh off the skin. dice the flesh and place in the serving dish. combine the other ingredients and whisk until the honey is fully combined. pour over the melon about 15 minutes before it is to be served and turn the fruit over in the sauce. chill and serve with cocktail sticks to pick the pieces up.',\n",
    " 'Assorted salad leaves with oenogarum': 'the sauce known as an oenogarum takes many forms. in this case it resembles a vinaigrette and is suitable to dress salad leaves to accompany all the other hors d’œuvre in this section. select chicory, baby spinach and beet leaves, rocket, dandelion, or loose-leaved lettuce of all kinds. wash and drain and just before your guests arrive, dress with the oenogarum that you will find on page 33 in the section on special ingredients.',\n",
    " 'Soft eggs in pine kernel sauce': 'this is a easy standby recipe that is similar to egg mayonnaise but with an extra kick from the lovage. the pine kernels are soaked in water or wine to soften them so that they make a soft creamy sauce.   100 g pine kernels  50 ml wine  1 dessert spoon honey  1 tbsp white wine vinegar  1 tbsp fish sauce  ½ tsp lovage seed  generous freshly ground black pepper  4 soft-boiled eggs, cooled and shelled      soak the pine kernels in the wine overnight. put them in a food processor with the honey, vinegar, and fish sauce, and process until smooth. roast and grind the lovage seeds, mix with black pepper, add to the sauce and taste. adjust the texture with the wine used to soak the pine kernels. shell the eggs carefully and cut them in half, spooning a little sauce on each half. serve with a green salad dressed with an oenogarum as above.',\n",
    " 'Sauce for cooked meat': 'many of the dishes in apicius are designed to utilize pre-cooked and technically ‘left over’ roasted meat from the previous evening. impressive whole roasted or boiled beasts were very common at wealthy dinners. we would consider them ‘cold cuts’: sliced or diced lamb, pork or beef ready prepared, so that the diner can simply pick up the meat and dip into various different piquant pickles. these last were often served cold, whether or not the meat was re-heated. the sauces were quite thick and clinging so that diners didn’t get sprinkled with sauce as they brought the meat up to their mouth. it must be borne in mind that the diner was reclining on a couch and only able to use one hand to feed himself. there are many recipes for sauces of this nature – and we have already seen a hypotrimma in the hors d’œuvre section, a greek version of the same kind of dip (p. 55). initially, i tried to interpret some of them in terms of a modern sauce, thin, hot, plentiful and pourable, and found them very unsatisfactory. when i considered them more as a pickle or dipping sauce, as in a chinese meal, the likely use of these sauces became clear. serve them in a little dish on a larger plate filled with sliced or diced cooked meat. this first such sauce (others are on pp. 71 and 75) is made with chopped cooked egg. it makes a superb accompaniment to cold lamb or any wild fowl.   1 heaped tsp cumin seeds  1 level tsp myrtle berries  generous freshly ground black pepper  2 heaped tsp chopped fresh parsley  ½ small leek with the dark green removed  2 hard-boiled eggs, shelled  2 dessert spoons honey  2 tbsp vinegar  2 tbsp olive oil  2 tbsp fish sauce    roast and grind the cumin and myrtle, mix with the pepper and combine with the parsley. chop the leek and cook in a little water. strain and place in a food processor or large mortar and grind or process into a paste. add the cooked eggs and process or grind again. add the spice and herb mixture, honey, vinegar, oil and fish sauce and blend by pulsing a few times. tip into a bowl and store until required. only store in the fridge if you are preparing or storing left-over sauce overnight. preparing it the day before does improve the flavour but bring back to room temperature before serving.',\n",
    " 'Baked ham in pastry with figs': 'this is a very simple dish that has no fish sauce or long list of spices; in fact it would not be out of place in any modern recipe book and probably survives in many cultures. the gammon is boiled with figs and bay, smothered in honey, then wrapped in a simple flour and oil pastry and baked. the meat finishes cooking in its case while retaining the juices, which caramelize with the honey – wonderful! the pastry is not thick and stodgy but similar to a strudel dough. if you wrap the meat a second time and oil between the layers you get a crisp and crunchy texture that works a treat.   1 kg piece of gammon, pre-soaked if necessary  5 dried figs  3 bay leaves  250 gm plain white flour  ¼ tsp salt  2 tbsp olive oil  100 ml water  100 g set honey  olive oil for brushing  fish sauce, or salt and honey for seasoning      cover the gammon in cold water, add the figs and bay leaves and bring to the boil. simmer for 20 minutes per 500 grams plus an extra 20 minutes. remove from the heat and cool in the water. while it is cooling, sieve the flour and salt together into a bowl and add the oil and the water gradually to form a dough. knead until smooth and pliable. this amount of dough should cover at least a two-kilo joint so adjust the amount to suit the size of your joint. cut the dough in half and roll one portion out into a large thin sheet. follow the method in the recipe for tracta on page 37. the pastry sheet should resemble that used for apple strudel rather than filo and the thicker edges of the sheet should be trimmed before you begin to wrap the meat.  place the meat on a board and remove the skin. score the fat with a knife right through to the flesh to create a criss-cross pattern. spread the honey over the fat and into the cuts. spread it over any surfaces of the lean meat too. brush your first pastry sheet with olive oil and lay the meat at one end. roll the meat up in the dough, fold over the edges to make a parcel, and brush its exterior with more oil. trim away any excess pastry. roll the other half of the dough into a sheet and brush its upper surface with olive oil. wrap the meat again, this time tucking the minimum amount of excess dough under the joint. brush the exterior with more oil. bake in a medium oven (375°f, 190°c, gas 5) for 1 hour until the pastry is crisp and light brown. remove and allow to stand for 10 minutes. strain 250 ml of the cooking liquor into a small pan and season with a little fish sauce or salt if desired, and a little honey. taste and adjust the balance of flavours. carve thick slices of meat and spoon a little of the liquor over them. serve it forth.',\n",
    " 'Chicken in sweet and sour sauce': 'the first part of this recipe is a remarkably good sweet and sour dipping sauce for chicken pieces. these are excellent for finger food and easily prepared for parties. roast or poach a whole chicken, or just breast meat, pull the breast into strips (or let your guests do this bit) and dip in the finished sauce. the original recipe includes laser root, which is not available, and i suggest asafoetida as an alternative. it probably does not have quite the same flavour as the root but if you have developed a taste for this pungent and unusual spice it will prove acceptable. even without it the sauce is very effective.   1 tsp dill seed  a pinch of asafoetida powder or resin (optional)  2 heaped tsp fresh chopped mint  2 tbsp white wine vinegar  2 tbsp date syrup  2 tbsp fish sauce  1 tbsp olive oil  1 dessert spoon whole-grain mustard  defrutum (see p. 30) to taste  a whole roast or poached chicken, jointed      dry-roast the dill (and the asafoetida if used) in a frying-pan and grind to a fine powder. chop the mint and combine with the spice in a bowl and add the other ingredients. mix well and allow to stand to combine the flavours. taste. if it is too sweet add a little more fish sauce, too vinegary a little defrutum. serve with cooked chicken pieces.',\n",
    " 'Roast chicken in a honey and dill glaze': 'the sweet and sour sauce on the previous page is transformed in the very next recipe in the apicius manuscript into a honey glaze. it is particularly effective with poussin or a larger organic corn-fed bird. try it with a guinea-fowl, as its flavour is probably closer to an ancient chicken than the rather bland meat of modern commerce.   1 batch of the sweet and sour sauce on the previous page  1 heaped tbsp set honey  1tbsp fish sauce  1 guinea-fowl or small organic chicken or 2 poussin      combine the ingredients and stir until smooth. prepare the chicken for cooking by removing excess skin and fat etc. parboil the bird in water for a maximum of three-quarters of an hour (depending on the age and size of the bird in question). pre-heat the oven to 375°f, 190°c, gas mark 5. drain the bird from the water and wipe dry with a clean cloth. arrange in a roasting dish and make deep cuts in the breast meat from front to back, 2 cuts on each side of the breast. cut deeply into the leg just once at its thickest point. pour the sauce over the chicken and baste so that the sauce penetrates into every cut. roast for a further 30 minutes to 1 hour until the juices run clear. every 10 minutes take the bird out of the oven and baste again. as the sauce reduces in the heat, it will become thick and sticky at the bottom of the pan. add a very little water if it gets too thick and proves difficult to baste with. you can either serve the chicken whole, sprinkled with freshly ground pepper, for your guests to pull apart or, as an alternative, use boned chicken breast and thigh cut into strips and marinated in the sauce for a few hours before flash roasting them and serving hot as before.',\n",
    " 'Duck with turnip': 'there is a traditional french duck recipe very similar to this save that the sauce is made with sherry instead of defrutum and the turnips are cooked separately. otherwise, the recipe seems not to have changed much in 2,000 years.   1 small duck with giblets  300 g baby turnips, trimmed  3 tbsp olive oil  2 tbsp fish sauce  200 ml white wine  ½ small leek  small handful fresh coriander  90 ml defrutum (see p. 30)      for the sauce:    2 tsp cumin  4 tsp coriander seeds  a large pinch of ground asafoetida, or ½ tsp of the powder (optional)  1 tsp black peppercorns  2 tbsp white wine vinegar  400 ml cooking liquor as stock  cornflour to thicken  defrutum/vinegar/fish sauce to taste      trim the duck and remove the wings. place in a large pan of water and bring to the boil. trim the turnips, peel if necessary, and bring them to the boil in a separate pan of salted water. drain, refresh under cold running water, and reserve. simmer the duck for 1 hour and then remove and dry the bird. put the giblets (not the liver) and the wings into the pan of duck stock and continue to cook. (if you like, add a chicken leg to improve the flavour.) strain and reserve 400 ml of stock for making the sauce.  put the duck in a large casserole and add the olive oil, fish sauce and the wine. cut the leek down the middle and tie the pieces back together with the coriander in the middle. add to the casserole along with the turnips. cover and put in a hot oven (400°f, 200°c, gas 6). bake for a further 45 minutes and then remove the lid. pour the defrutum over the duck and continue to roast, basting frequently until the skin is crisp and the juices from the leg run clear. if the juices in the casserole seem to reduce too much, add a little of the stock.  while it is cooking, make the sauce. dry-roast the cumin, coriander and asafoetida until they give off their flavour and spit a little. grind into a fine powder with the pepper. blend with the vinegar and put in a small saucepan.  when the duck is very crisp and the legs pull easily from the carcass, remove from the oven and keep warm on a serving dish with the turnips. deglaze the casserole with the reserved stock. tip into a jug and allow to stand until the fat settles on the surface. scoop most of the fat off with a ladle and remove the remainder with kitchen paper. add to the saucepan with the spices and blend together. bring to heat and thicken with a little cornflour; taste. adjust the sweet/ sour/salt balance with more defrutum/vinegar/fish sauce as required. pour over the duck and serve.',\n",

    " 'Chicken or guinea-fowl in the style of Vardanus': 'this is an unusual roman recipe in that it contains no spices apart from pepper. it is subtle in flavour, creamy and quite delicious. the sauce is very rich and even contains egg white, which inevitably causes the sauce to split, but don’t see this as a problem. the original apician recipe uses chicken but it must be remembered that early chickens were likely to be much tastier than our modern breeds. an organic corn-fed chicken is suitable for a spicy roman dish but a dish like this requires a more robust taste. the guinea-fowl is of african origin and it became popular in roman kitchens in the empire. it is missing from apicius but the guinea-fowl is so similar in shape and texture to chicken that it was almost certainly used in those recipes that are grouped together under the collective title pullum ‘chicken’. its meat is darker and has a gamy hint. the dish is best served with a starch component such as rice or cracked wheat.   1 guinea-fowl  500 ml medium sweet wine  40 ml olive oil  2 tbsp fish sauce  1 leek  20 stalks with leaf of fresh coriander  3 sprigs summer or winter savory or, if unavailable, thyme  generous freshly ground pepper  75 g pine kernels  60 ml goats’, sheep’s or cows’ milk  1 raw egg white  300 ml cooking liquor    trim and joint the guinea-fowl into 8 pieces: 4 pieces of breast, 2 thighs and 2 drumsticks. place the wine, olive oil, and fish sauce in a pan or casserole and put in the guinea-fowl pieces. make sure the pan is big enough to allow all the joints to be covered by the liquid. add water if necessary.  trim the green from the leek and cut the white part in half and down the middle into 4 even pieces. put 2 of the pieces on a board with a long piece of kitchen string underneath. fold the coriander so it is the same length as the leek, lay the savory on the top and lay the other 2 pieces of leek on top of that and then bind them securely across their length. place the bundle in the pan (also covered by the liquid), allowing some string to hang over the edge of the pan.  bring this all to a gentle simmer, cover at all times and cook for roughly 1½ hours until the meat easily pulls away from the bone. remove the meat and keep warm.  reduce the cooking liquor by boiling hard until you are left with 300 ml. if you are in a hurry, you can simply measure out this quantity and discard the remainder.  ideally you will need a pestle and mortar for the next stage, but a food processor will suffice. grind the pepper and pine kernels to a fine paste. if you have used a processor the texture will remain grainy for some time. add the milk slowly to form a soft paste. then add the egg white, stirring gently (do not incorporate air). place the cool cooking liquor in a small pan and add the pine nut mixture. place on a gentle heat, stirring all the time, until the required thickness is achieved. pour over the guinea-fowl. sprinkle with ground black pepper and some fresh coriander leaves.',\n",
    " 'Cold sauce for pork': 'this cold sauce is reminiscent of modern-day sweet pickles. it is rich and piquant and goes especially well with pork. the recipe was originally conceived for boiled pork but roasting gives a better texture to any meat. it can be used as a dip or spooned onto the meat before serving. it is ideally made in a wide, deep mortar but a hand blender is also effective.   2 level tsp caraway seeds  60 g pine kernels  1 tsp green dill  ½ tsp oregano  2 tbsp vinegar  1 tbsp fish sauce  2 dessert spoons date syrup  2 dessert spoons honey  40 g whole grain mustard  generous freshly ground black pepper      roast and grind the seeds. place in a blender jug and add the pine kernels, mustard and all the other ingredients. blend until a coarse but uniform texture is achieved. if you are using a mortar, grind the pine kernels into a paste before blending with the thicker liquids (date syrup, honey), then the thin liquids (vinegar, fish sauce), and the seasonings.',\n",

    " 'Ofellae Apician style': 'this version of ofellae is associated with the gourmet marcus gavius apicius himself and may have been a favourite of his. the belly pork is roasted and finished in a sweet oenogarum flavoured with pepper, lovage and a root known as ‘sweet rush’ (cyperus esculentus). i have been unable to find this root in spice merchants, although it is available in france under the name amande de terre (and known in english as chufa or tiger nut). i have experimented with ginger as well as sweet galingale, which is closely related to cyperus and has a bitter-sweet taste, and have found them both quite successful.   1 kg slab of belly pork, boned  generous freshly ground black pepper  2 tsp cumin seeds  ½ tsp lovage seeds  1 level tsp ground ginger or galingale  150 ml passum or half plain wine and half raisin wine (see p. 32)  60 ml fish sauce  1 tbsp olive oil      to prepare the belly pork, trim any loose flaps of meat. score it into cubes 3 cm square, still attached to the skin, in the manner described in the previous recipe.  turn the meat into a roasting tin and sprinkle it with olive oil. roast in a medium oven (375°f, 190°c, gas 5) until well done and coming away from the skin relatively easily. roast and grind the spices and put in a small saucepan with the passum (or wines) and fish sauce. add a little oil and heat. take the meat from the oven and cut the individual chunks from the slab. drop them in the sauce. cut down to the skin and take the fat layers too as they are very tasty. bring the meat to the boil in the sauce and simmer gently for 10–15 minutes or until most of the sauce has evaporated. spoon out the meat and serve sprinkled with black pepper.',\n",
    " 'Terentine minutal': 'this recipe for a minutal, a basic stew, is made with mince (latin isicia) which was certainly an everyday ingredient. other minutals are often made with cooked meat (see the next recipe). it is a creamy and soft pottage, a true ‘comfort food’ in texture, while also having the subtle tang of celery and lovage. it is thickened with a special dried pastry known as tracta (see page 37) which means it’s a meal in itself: starch and meat combined. tracta has often been regarded as a form of pasta, but the distinction between the two is clear. the pieces of tracta are quite fine and release their starch slowly into the sauce, while pasta has no thickening qualities. the original isicia recipe calls for a specific terentine flavouring which we are never told about. i have devised a seasoning to go with the mince which complements the rest of the dish. you could use any favourite spice to flavour the mince – feel free to experiment.   300 g minced lamb  2 tsp dried mint  1 level tsp celery seed  generous freshly ground pepper  1 tbsp fish sauce  20 g soft bread crumbs      for the sauce:    500 ml lamb stock (cube or fresh)  1 tbsp fish sauce (and more, perhaps, at the end)  40 ml olive oil  1 small leek, chopped  ½ tsp lovage seed  ½ tsp dried oregano or 1 tsp fresh oregano  50 ml passum (see p. 32)  100 ml wine  2–3 discs of tracta (see p. 37) or cornflour to thicken    place the mince, mint, roasted and ground celery seed, pepper, fish sauce and bread crumbs in a food processor and grind together as finely as possible. the appearance should be that of pâté. put the stock, olive oil and 1 tbsp fish sauce in a separate pan and add the chopped leek. bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. ladle some of the stock into the food processor with the meat and blend it smooth, add a second ladle-full and blend again. when it is smooth and fine enough to pour from the bowl, add it to the rest of the stock in the pan. blend the two together carefully. the meat should not clump together. bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 15–20 minutes. dry-roast the lovage and grind and add it along with the oregano. add the passum and wine. in a mortar or food processor pound the tracta to a coarse grain. add them to the pan gradually by sprinkling the grains into the meat sauce and stirring each time. the starch will be released slowly into the sauce and it will take time to thicken completely. finish cooking the sauce. you will not necessarily use all the tracta. taste and adjust the seasoning with more fish sauce if necessary and add plenty of freshly ground black pepper.',\n",
    " 'Pork and apricot minutal': 'this minutal is made with diced cooked meat rather than mince as in the previous recipe. the stew has a distinct texture due to the fact that the meat was pre-cooked. though it is quite possible to use raw pork and cook it in the stock, it would not produce an authentic minutal. minutals tend to be sweet and sour in flavour and cumin is a common seasoning.   500 g pork joint  300 ml sweet white wine  300 ml stock/water  300 ml olive oil  2 tbsp fish sauce  2 medium onions or, if available, large bulbed spring or young onions  in the green  1 tsp cumin seeds  ½ tsp black peppercorns  1 tsp dill weed, chopped  1 dessert spoon set honey  1 tbsp passum (see p. 32)  2 tbsp vinegar  80 g fresh or semi dried apricots  3 discs of tracta (see p. 37) or cornflour to thicken      rub olive oil and salt into the skin of the pork and roast in a hot oven until the skin is crisp and the meat is well done. allow to cool and dice the meat into chunks. place the wine, stock, olive oil, fish sauce and the chopped onion in a saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer and continue until the onion is cooked. add the diced pork along with any meat juices (skimmed of fat) and cook together. roast the cumin and grind with the pepper and add along with the dill, honey, passum, vinegar and the apricots. continue to cook together. grind the tracta into a coarse grain and add to the pan, stirring all the time. the starch will be released slowly into the sauce and it will take time to thicken completely. you may not need to use all the tracta. finish cooking and taste. adjust the seasoning with more fish sauce if necessary.',\n",

    " 'Spring cabbage and chicken patina': 'many commentators have had problems interpreting this particular recipe in the original manuscript. the issues it raises are complex and it is discussed in detail in our own edition of apicius. the main problem stems from the assumption that green vegetables of all kinds ought to be cooked before they can be combined with egg and turned into a patina. the recipe for patina of asparagus on page 52 (apicius 4.2.5 & 6), which precedes this one in the original text, does not require that the asparagus be cooked, but simply pounded in its raw state and soaked in wine before straining out the green matter. the fresh green liquor produces a delicious fresh-tasting patina that resembles a soufflé. this recipe says that wild herbs, black briony, mustard greens, cucumber or spring greens can be cooked in the same way. some commentators have assumed this to be mistaken and that some cooking process was omitted from the instructions which survive. we cannot know exactly what happened here but, if the non-cooked version tastes particularly good, then it seems unnecessary to alter the recipe. i have made this patina with spring cabbage and even parsley and spinach and the results are simply outstanding.  were you to follow the recommendation of the original manu¬script and try this recipe using cucumbers, you should note that ancient cucumbers were closer to a melon or gourd in texture. modern varieties are too watery to be successful. i would counsel buying a gourd or squash from a shop which supplies indian or asian customers.   300 g spring cabbage, flat-leaf parsley, or spinach  300 ml white wine  ½ medium-sized onion  2 tbsp olive oil  small handful fresh coriander (a quarter-bunch)  ½ tsp dried savory or thyme  ½ tsp lovage seed  generous freshly ground black pepper  1 tbsp fish sauce  4 eggs  1 chicken breast cooked and sliced    chop the green leaves fairly small and then place them in a food processor to grind them as small as possible. add the wine and continue to pulse for a few seconds. if cabbage is used, the smell will be rather off-putting at this stage – it will appear that you have been boiling cabbage in your house for ever – but it will dissipate! leave the cabbage and wine to marinate for a few hours. pass the mixture through a fine sieve to press out all the liquor, which you save for the next stage.  peel and chop the onion finely and fry in a little oil until trans¬parent. purée the onion in a mortar, a small food processor or a hand blender, then add the rest of the oil, coriander, savory, lovage, pepper and fish sauce. continue to pound or process to a coarse texture. combine the retained vegetable liquor, the sauce and 4 eggs and beat smooth. grease a small ceramic dish with oil and place a layer of chicken breast on the bottom. pour the mixture on top and place the vessel inside another larger dish and fill this with water. bake in a cool oven (300°f, 150°c, gas 2) for roughly 30 minutes until just set. the onion and herbs will settle on the surface in a separate layer unless you stir at the last moment. cool and serve either as a side-dish with the main course or as a starter. alternatively, bake in individual ramekins. sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper.',\n",

    " 'Patina Apiciana (pasta)': 'this recipe has often been associated with lasagna as it uses layers of a wheat-based product that has been interpreted as pasta, with meat and fish in a sauce that is thickened with egg between the layers. these layers are called lagana, which is a medieval italian dialect term for pasta, but in roman times the term referred to unleavened bread. the finished dish is made in a vessel but there the resemblance to lasagna ceases, for it is not put in the oven and is subsequently turned out onto a serving dish. it is also apparent that the layers are not single: bread, sauce, bread, sauce but make use of a double layer of bread. the latin original is quite specific and i think it refers to each ‘layer’ being made up of two layers of bread with the sauce in the middle. the diner then takes this off the pile as a single serving and rolls it up like a hot wrap.  the filling has many different kinds of meat and fish bound in a thick sauce. the recipe calls for udder, which we don’t often knowingly consume these days but we can substitute belly pork; a cooked fish of your choice, any firm white fish will do; chicken meat; and meat from a game bird. in addition, an italian sausage will be suitable, even mushrooms and literally anything else that’s of good quality, to quote the latin. you can use any meat, fish or vegetable that you particularly like. this dish is intended to be made from left-over foods, mainly roasted meats served the previous evening and returned to the kitchen to be used again. this means that to duplicate the dish you need to have a similar situation. after a large family party or even after christmas would be a good time to try this, when a selection of meat and fish is available. you will only need a relatively small quantity of each. an alternative is to make a large quantity for a party. the dish looks good and tastes familiar, even modern. if you want to serve a roman meal to guests who might find some of the more intense roman sauces a bit too out-of-the ordinary, this is ideal.   75 g belly pork or cold roast meat  75 g cooked chicken breast  75 g cooked breast meat from either pheasant, guinea-fowl or quail,  50 g cooked large prawns or lobster  50 g cooked firm white fish such as skate  400 ml white wine  100 ml passum (see p. 32)  1 tsp ground lovage seeds  1 tsp chopped lovage leaf or parsley  generous freshly ground pepper  2–3 tbsp fish sauce  50 ml concentrated cooking liquor  50 g mushrooms or leek  50 g smoked sausage or any meatball recipe from the hors d’œuvre  section  cornflour to thicken  3 eggs  3 tbsp olive oil  1 batch of lagana bread (p. 35)  100 gms pine-kernels  1 tbsp whole black peppercorns      all the meat and fish needs to be cooked in advance. when you roast, or poach in a little water, reserve the cooking liquor and meat juices. if you are using left-over meats, make a little stock with the carcasses. put the wine and passum in a saucepan and add the ground lovage, lovage leaf, pepper, fish sauce and concentrated cooking liquor. add the mushrooms or any other vegetable used and cook them in the sauce. chop the meat into small pieces roughly 2 cm square, slice the sausage, peel the prawns and place all the ingredients in the sauce and bring to the boil. simmer gently until everything is well blended: do not over-cook. thicken with the cornflour. blend the eggs with the oil and stir into the hot mixture, turning it from the bottom at all times, and continue to cook over a low heat until the eggs begin to set the sauce. do not boil vigorously and take off the heat when it is thick enough. you will need a deep, straight-sided casserole roughly 20 cm across and the same diameter as the flat bread known as lagana. put in one flat bread, then a ladle of the meat and fish sauce and spread it out right to the edges. sprinkle the sauce with peppercorns and pine-kernels. the casserole ensures the sauce does not run over the edges. cover with 2 flat breads and then 1 ladle of sauce, another 2 flat breads and 1 ladle of sauce until you use up all the sauce. turn it out immediately and serve or hold in a warm oven until ready to serve. this makes 10 servings of bread and sauce.'}"
